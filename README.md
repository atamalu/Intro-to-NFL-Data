# Introduction to NFL Data
An introduction to acquiring, manipulating, and visualizing NFL data; especially for fantasy football.

Fantasy football is very popular. This combined with the boom in availability of sports has resulted in many statisticians and data scientists joining the hobby of trying to out-predict everyone else's football projections. 

After looking across the web, I was unable to find an adequate amount of information gathered into 1 place. There is only 1 R package and it pretty much only grabs play-by-play data. Because of this, I decided to make some brief walk-throughs on how to acquire and explore NFL data in a meaningful way.
